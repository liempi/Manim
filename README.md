Hello! Here you would find some animations made in **Manim**.

Hola! Aquí iré dejando algunas animaciones que he hecho en **Manim**.

I'm currently using **MacOs** but before I worked with **Windows** and **Linux**, so I would help you if you couldn't install them.

# Installation
## MacOS
### Pre-requirements
* **Python 3.x**

If you don't have **Python** already you should consider install from the official web-site.

https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/

Here just click the appropiated version of your **MacOs**. If you are not sure, don't worry, go to the terminal and type:

<pre><code> uman -m
</code></pre>

You will see the **arch** of your system like this:

<pre><code> x86_64
</code></pre>

* **Homebrew**

I recommend to install the  **Homebrew** package because this is a easy way to install the dependecies used in Manim.
